# cloudtypes-app

Ideally, a little react app that contains information about and photos of all the cloud types.
I'm starting with a my own bundle of data, but hopefully I can eventually find a nice API to pull data from.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
