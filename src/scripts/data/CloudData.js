      "formation": "When the wind blows against a hill or mountain it is forced to lift. Air cools as it rises and the water vapour within it condenses to form a cloud. As the name implies, these clouds form in a layer and then remain also stationary as the wind continuously flows from one direction. The prevailing wind determines the particular microclimates found around a hill or mountain. Areas to the leeward side of the hill can often experience shelter, with more sunshine, less rainfall and higher temperatures than areas to the windward side. Banner clouds form on the sheltered leeward side of the mountain.",

      "formation": "The way in which asperitas clouds form is somewhat a mystery, yet there is much debate and confusion over how the wave-like clouds come into existence. It is hypothesised that their appearance is associated with the aftermath of convective thunderstorms, though they have also been sighted in relatively calm environments. One theory does suggest that they are formed when mammatus clouds descend into areas of the sky where wind direction changes with height causing the wave-like movement.",

      "description": "Nacreous clouds form in the lower stratosphere over polar regions when the sun is just below the horizon. The clouds are illuminated from below and often glow in vivid colours and will often remain visible for a couple of hours after sunset and through the night as they are lit by moonlight",
      "formation": "The water droplets which form nacreous clouds are much smaller than those forming more common clouds. The smaller droplets scatter light in a different way which is what creates the distinctive luminescent appearance.",

      "description": "Kelvin-Helmholtz is an extremely rare phenomenon where a cloud produces a billowing wave pattern. The distinctive cloud occurs when there is a strong vertical shear between two air streams causing winds to blow faster at the upper level than at the lower levels.",
